# AGENTS.md — Pi-Grok Native TUI

## Project root and Git

`grok-build-main/` is the project root and the **only** Git working tree.

```text
origin   https://github.com/Dwsy/grok-pi.git
upstream https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build.git
base     3af4d5d39897855bdcc74f23e690024a5dc05573
```

- Work from this directory; do not use its parent wrapper as a repository.
- `origin/main` is the Pi-Grok integration branch; `upstream` is read-only Grok Build.
- Never directly merge an upstream root commit into this repository without a migration plan. Reapply the narrow integration seams and validate them instead.
- Keep commits focused. Do not stage generated `pi-main` model catalog changes unless they are intentional.
- Pi host default is **system `pi` >= 0.80.10** (`npm i -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`). Override with `--pi-bin` / `PI_BIN`.
- Optional Pi source checkout is the git submodule [`pi-main`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) (not a vendored copy). Follow [`pi-main/AGENTS.md`](pi-main/AGENTS.md) when working inside the submodule.

## Upstream sync workflow

Syncing upstream Grok Build is a **two-phase** process. Always record what
upstream changed *before* merging it.

1. **Fill the upstream update record first.** Run the
   [`upstream-changelog`](.pi/skills/upstream-changelog/SKILL.md) skill (trigger:
   `/skill:upstream-changelog`, or "上游更新记录" / "fill the upstream update
   list"). It fetches `upstream`, computes the pending range
   (`merge-base HEAD upstream/main .. upstream/main`), transcribes the
   `Changes:` list from each upstream commit message, and writes a structured
   English entry to [`docs/upstream/UPSTREAM_CHANGELOG.md`](docs/upstream/UPSTREAM_CHANGELOG.md).
   This step is **read-only** — it records changes but merges nothing.
2. **Then merge.** Only after the changelog entry exists, proceed with the
   isolated-worktree merge, seam reapplication, and validation (see the
   `docs/issues/架构/` sync issues). Never merge an upstream root commit
   directly into `main` without this plan.

Upstream commits are titled `Synced from monorepo` but each carries a full
`Changes:` bullet list and a `Source-Revision:` trailer — the changelog skill
transcribes those as the authoritative feature list (diff analysis is only a
fallback for commits lacking a `Changes:` list). `SOURCE_REV`, `AGENTS.md`
`base`, and verifier baselines are updated only after a completed, verified
merge — never by the changelog skill.

## Architecture invariants

1. **Grok Pager is the only terminal UI.** All visible terminal surfaces must come from `xai-grok-pager` or native component crates.
2. **Pi is the only agent core.** Pi owns models, providers, agent loop, tools, extensions, compaction, retries, and sessions.
3. **`pi-grok-adapter` is headless and library-only.** It may translate JSONL RPC ↔ ACP, but must not render widgets, own a terminal, read keyboard events, or depend on Ratatui/Crossterm.
4. **Reuse native Grok surfaces.** Map Pi capabilities to existing Pager prompt, slash, QuestionView, toast, banner, tool card, diff, and scrollback surfaces. Do not create a second TUI or ASCII fallback UI.
5. **Do not modify Pi source to extend RPC.** When a Pi core capability is not exposed over RPC, prefer the official extension API. Preserve Pi semantics rather than emulating them with JSONL edits or unrelated RPCs.
6. **Product-isolated state trees.** grok-pi must not share stock Grok’s user or project config roots (see [Product state isolation](#product-state-isolation)).

Read [`NATIVE_GROK_TUI_ALIGNMENT.md`](NATIVE_GROK_TUI_ALIGNMENT.md) and [`FEATURE_MATRIX.md`](FEATURE_MATRIX.md) before changing protocol or UI behavior.

## Product state isolation

Stock Grok uses `~/.grok` (user) and `<repo>/.grok` (project). **grok-pi defaults are product-isolated** so UI settings, trust, skills, hooks, and workflows do not collide with stock Grok:

| Layer | stock Grok | grok-pi default | Override |
|---|---|---|---|
| User home | `~/.grok` | `~/.grok-pi` | `$GROK_HOME` |
| Project tree | `<repo>/.grok` | `<repo>/.grok-pi` | `$GROK_PROJECT_DIR` |

Rules:

- `ensure_default_grok_home()` (grok-pi startup) sets `$GROK_HOME` → `~/.grok-pi` and `$GROK_PROJECT_DIR` → `.grok-pi` when unset.
- Resolve project paths only via `xai_grok_config::project_config_dirname()` / `project_config_dir(root)` — never hardcode `.join(".grok")` for project assets in grok-pi production code.
- User paths go through `grok_home()` / `$GROK_HOME` (workflows → `$GROK_HOME/workflows`, config → `$GROK_HOME/config.toml`, etc.).
- **No dual-scan of stock trees by default.** grok-pi does not auto-read `~/.grok` or `<repo>/.grok` for project discovery; migrate with `grok-pi migrate-home` (allowlisted user files only — **not** `workflows/`) or copy project trees manually into `.grok-pi`.
- Unit tests without env keep the stock default `.grok` so upstream-style tests stay green.
- Design note: [`docs/issues/架构/20260722-项目级.grok-pi隔离.md`](docs/issues/架构/20260722-项目级.grok-pi隔离.md).

Examples under a git repo:

```text
~/.grok-pi/config.toml              # F2 / UI (e.g. [ui].pi_workflows)
~/.grok-pi/workflows/*.rhai         # user workflows
<repo>/.grok-pi/workflows/*.rhai    # project workflows (folder trust)
<repo>/.grok-pi/hooks/              # project hooks
<repo>/.grok-pi/config.toml         # project config overlay
```

## Important paths

| Pi RPC facts (submodule / installed package) | `pi-main/packages/coding-agent/src/modes/rpc/` or npm package dist |
| Pi session lifecycle facts | `pi-main/packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` |
| Architecture and task records | `docs/` |

## Session and tree rules

- Pi owns session files, trees, and the active leaf.
- `/resume` must use the native Grok `SessionPicker`; catalog scanning is on-demand, never startup work.
- Respect Pi's default session root, `--session-dir`, `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR`, and `sessionFile`-derived custom directories.
- `navigateTree()` changes Pi's in-memory leaf and context. Do not fake it with `fork`, `switch_session`, or direct JSONL mutation.
- If tree navigation is added without changing Pi source, bridge the official Pi extension API (`ctx.navigateTree`) and render only with native Grok components.

## Build and verification

Run from the project root:

```bash
./build.sh
cargo test -p pi-grok-adapter
cargo test -p xai-grok-pager-bin --bin grok-pi
cargo check -p xai-grok-pager-bin --bin grok-pi
```

`./build.sh` builds `grok-pi` (and optionally the `pi-main` submodule if present). Requires system Pi >= **0.80.10**, Node.js >= 22.19.0, and the repository Rust toolchain.

`./verify.sh` additionally runs architecture, mock, syntax, and Pager checks. Current known infrastructure blockers are documented in [`VERIFICATION.md`](VERIFICATION.md): Python tree-sitter dependencies are not provisioned, and Pager focused lib tests have an upstream cross-crate test-helper configuration issue. Do not claim full verification is green unless those blockers are resolved.

For a standalone change under `extensions/`, validate the extension source and diff only; do **not** run Cargo unless Rust code, the embedded-extension loader, or its Rust contract changed, or the user asks.

Before reporting completion:

1. Run the narrowest relevant tests and build/check.
2. Read the exit status and complete output.
3. Review the diff for scope and whitespace errors.
4. State known blockers separately from passing checks.

## Documentation and change control

- Complex work must have a record in `docs/issues/` before implementation.
- Update the relevant Issue after each completed phase.
- Keep `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `FEATURE_MATRIX.md`, and `VERIFICATION.md` aligned with actual behavior.
- The source-identity verifier allows only declared Pager seams. If a required native seam changes, update its baseline/allowed-seam metadata deliberately; never weaken the verifier broadly.

## Safety

- Do not run destructive Git commands (`reset --hard`, broad restore, force checkout).
- Do not remove source files with `rm`; use `trash` for intentional deletion.
- Do not push, rename, delete, or recreate remote repositories unless the user explicitly authorizes it.
- Treat credentials, tokens, and user session data as private.
